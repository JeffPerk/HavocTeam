# About

Arcadian GT provides a modified [DEGA](https://github.com/deltagamer/DEGA_SUV) SUV that features Theseus Services specific paint colors, improved tire armor, alternate engine and surface sounds. Additionally the vehicle transmission mechanics have been changed to better represent how this vehicle package would likely perform. The goal of this extension mod is to replicate a heavy duty SUV powered by a diesel engine conversion, with the passenger area armored with hardened ballistic steel and multi-layered ballistic glass, running on a high grade run-flat tire system.

Features four color variants: Black, Green, Grey & Tan.
