# About

Arcadian GT is an optional extension of Theseus Services providing a modified [CUP](http://cup-arma3.org/) SUV that features Theseus Services specific paint colors, improved tire armor, alternate engine and surface sounds, and the removal of the side mount passenger positions. Additionally the vehicle transmission mechanics have been changed to better represent how this vehicle package would likely perform. The goal of this extension mod is to replicate a heavy duty SUV powered by a diesel engine conversion, with the passenger area armored with hardened ballistic steel and multi-layered ballistic glass, running on a high grade run-flat tire system. At the moment the tires are the only up-armored piece of the vehicle/crew survival features. Ultimately the vehicle's body and windows will be upgraded to better protect the passengers.

Features three color variants: Black, Earth, and Foliage.
